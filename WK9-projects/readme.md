# Week 9 Homework

My visualization is a treemap of population by country in 2100, grouped by region. The data is from the UN Population Division, available at https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/.

I wanted to practice using tooltips and hover effects. In order to not place rectangular tooltips on top of the treemap rectangles, I chose to just add tooltip text without a background, and add a white halo around the text so it is always legible.

Default state:

Hover:
