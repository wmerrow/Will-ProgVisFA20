Week 5 Homework

My visualization is a tile map showing the competitiveness of U.S. Senate races in the 2020 election according to race ratings from the Cook Political Report, available at https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings

I wanted to use color and opacity to emphasize the closest races, and chose a dark background so that the toss up color (white) would stand out more.
