# Week 9 Homework 2

My visualization is a network showing how often Supreme Court justices agreed with one another on court cases in the 2019 term. The data is from the Supreme Court Database by Washington University Law, available at http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php. I created a links file using Excel by finding the unique pairs of justices, calculating the total number of times each pair voted the same way in a case.

I was interested in learning how often justices actually agreed with one another, and whether the , and wanted the user to be able to see the actual percent agreement, not just the relative level of agremeent, so included the percentages in tooltips.
